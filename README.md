# Recipe_Finder

# Background
Do you ever have trouble picking out a recipe for dinner? Are you tired of cooking the same things over and over again? Have you ever wondered if your pulled pork recipe is the best one out there?

Well look no further! The goal of this project is to use web scraping to find the best recipes on the web and return them to you for easy access. Want to bake a coconut cake but not sure which recipe to choose? Just enter 'coconut cake' and get a list of the top recipes delievered right to your screen! All in a (relatively) short amount of time!
